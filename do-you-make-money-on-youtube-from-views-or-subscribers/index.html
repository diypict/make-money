<h3 id="probably-the-most-common-question-about-making-money-on-youtube-is-the-number-of-subscribers-you-need-to-have-to-start-earning-money">Probably The Most Common Question About Making Money On Youtube Is The Number Of Subscribers You Need To Have To Start Earning Money.</h3><p>At this level of viewership, you’ll actually be making $2 per 1,000 views too. Youtube requires a minimum of 1000 subscribers and 4000 watch hours to make money; There are 100s of variables involved, but for a quick calculation, you can use $1.5 per thousand views for small channels and $2 per thousand views for medium sized channels. Its a free 10 part video training where.</p>
<h3 id="in-my-study-based-on-100-channels-the-average-revenue-paid-to-youtube-creators-was-640-per-1000-views-rpm">In My Study Based On 100 Channels, The Average Revenue Paid To Youtube Creators Was $6.40 Per 1,000 Views (Rpm).</h3><p>Though, they based their rate per 1,000 views at $3 to $5. Money you can make from every 1,000 views on youtube. This means that these youtubers earn between $4,380 and $6,400 on 1 million views. So, your revenue is actually doubled compared to the previous tier.</p>
<h3 id="however-this-is-a-process-that-can-take-a-long-time">However, This Is A Process That Can Take A Long Time.</h3><p>If you just use straight forward math then you would think that with an average of us 1.8 cents per view on a video that is monetized with adsense ads, you would make around us $18 for every 1,000 views that you get. The median rpm was $4.38. In practice, ad views are not equal to video views, so the average payment for each individual video view is around $3 to $5 per 1,000 views. That’s based on an average rate of $0.18 per view (or $18 per 1,000 views).</p>
<h3 id="some-ads-pay-per-view-but-many-ads-pay-per-click">Some Ads Pay Per View, But Many Ads Pay Per Click.</h3><p>Now, i started this channel about 10 years ago b.

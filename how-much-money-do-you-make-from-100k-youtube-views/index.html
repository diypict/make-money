<p>So, if your videos get one million views, you can expect to earn anywhere between $3,400 to $40,000. There�s not really a difference between 100k views and 1m views other than the pure amount of them. Of the six countries in comparison, a youtuber in australia with 100k subscribers and with 50% of his subscribers watching the video will earn the most with $1,862 followed by the usa with $1,689 followed by canada with $1,509 then new zealand with $1,462 then the uk with $1,131. How Much Money Do You Get For 100k Views On YouTube YouTube.</p>
<h3 id="here-is-how-much-money-you-make-just-from-youtube-ad-revenue">Here Is How Much Money You Make Just From Youtube Ad Revenue.</h3><p>Youtube pays between $0.10 and $0.30 per ad view. This is the average earning calculation that you can expect from your channel through ads when you reach one million views mark. In practice, ad views are not equal to video views, so the average payment for each individual video view is around $3 to $5 per 1,000 views. This ranking is based on the annual earnings youtube channel creators in 2021.</p>
<h3 id="however-the-pay-rate-varies-dramatically-depending-on-engagement-type-of-content-and-other-revenue-streams">However, The Pay Rate Varies Dramatically Depending On Engagement, Type Of Content, And Other Revenue Streams.</h3><p>There�s not really a difference between 100k views and 1m views other than the pure amount of them. Many creators in my study reported making between $4,000 and $6,000 on 1 million views. The average amount youtubers make per 1 million views usually falls between $2,000 and $4,000. That means that if you have a channel that makes $10 per 1000 views, it would require 10,000 views for you to get paid by youtube once you’re in the youtube partner program.</p>
<h3 id="that039s-a-whopping-24000-to-40000-per-month-in-ad-revenue-alone">That�s A Whopping $24,000 To $40,000 Per Month In Ad Revenue Alone.</h3><p>Here�s how much an active youtuber could make by releasing 2 videos per week: So you’ll need about 6,000 to 25,000 views to make your first $100, and 60,000 to 250,000 views to make $1000. So, if your videos get one million views, you can expect to earn anywhere between $3,400 to $40,000. Once your channel is monetized, you will earn between $0.004 and $0.016 per view.</p>
<h3 id="to-earn-1000-youll-need-between-250000-and-450000-views-on-your-videos">To Earn $1,000, You’ll Need Between 250,000 And 450,000 Views On Your Videos.</h3><p>Because of those reasons, the actual pay per video view on youtube is $0.003 to $0.005. If we translate this into average payments, we can safely say that the average is $0.18 per ad view. This is a complicated question to answer. That indicates that youtube makes $3 to $5 per every 1,000 views their videos receive.</p>

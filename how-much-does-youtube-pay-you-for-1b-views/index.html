<h3 id="how-much-does-youtube-pay-you-for-1-million-views-in-kenya">How Much Does Youtube Pay You For 1 Million Views In Kenya?</h3><p>Youtube pays around $7500.00 for 1 million views. In other words, the more views you get over a longer period of time, the higher. Google pays out 68% of their adsense revenue, so for every $100 an advertiser pays, google pays $68 to the publisher. Below is the calculation per 1 million views:</p>
<h3 id="in-this-way-it-is-possible-to-take-as-a-reference-that-youtube-pays-around--500-to--2500-for-every-100000-visits-as-we">In This Way, It Is Possible To Take As A Reference That Youtube Pays Around $ 500 To $ 2,500 For Every 100,000 Visits, As We.</h3><p>Youtube’s calculation is done with a system called as cpm or in other words cost per 1 thousand views. To enable ads on your youtube videos, you are required to agree to google’s ad revenue share, which is a 32/68 split for all youtube content creators, meaning that for every $100 advertiser pays, google keeps $32 and you get the remaining $68. So, if your videos get one million views, you can expect to earn anywhere between $3,400 to $40,000. The actual rates an advertiser pays varies, usually between $0.10 to $0.30 per view, but averages out at $0.18 per view.</p>

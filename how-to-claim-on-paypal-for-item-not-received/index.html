I sold a $200 camera and it shows on tracking that it was delivered yesterday morning. On aug 4th, i wrote a complaint message in ebay’s webpage. Once the item had arrived, the buyer sent me a text message to say that he had received it and he was very happy.</p>
<h3 id="escalate-it-to-a-claim-asap">Escalate It To A Claim Asap.</h3><p>The first thing you should do is contact the seller and ask for a resolution to your problem. A few weeks later the buyer launched a paypal dispute claiming the item was not received and that the tracking number on auspost was a �fake� i informed the buyer via the paypal dispute. Enter in the tracking number along with all the relevant info including the delivery notation. When the items are delivered, they can be tracked to the specific gps.</p>

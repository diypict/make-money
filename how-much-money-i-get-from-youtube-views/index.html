This, of course, all depends on buying power. As you can tell by the above numbers, the earnings can fluctuate… a lot! On average, you could earn $38,000 when a video reaches 20 million views.</p>
<h3 id="as-far-as-100-views-are-concerned-it-depends-on-how-many-people-click-or-watch-the">As Far As 100 Views Are Concerned, It Depends On How Many People Click Or Watch The.</h3><p>So you’ll need about 6,000 to 25,000 views to make your first $100, and 60,000 to 250,000 views to make $1000. The famous channels makes more per milli than the small channels. Once you get your channel monetized, every single view will make you around $0.004 to $0.016 per view.

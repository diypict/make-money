<p>For example, cpm (cost per 1000 impressions) for your website is $1 and you get 1500 ad impressions on your site. If you need to show your contract with adsense, you can print the adsense terms and conditions. Google adsense’s payment threshold is $100, meaning you have to make at least $100 by the end of the payment period (this is usually around the 20th to the 26th each month), otherwise adsense will hold on to that money until you reach that $100 threshold. You accrue estimated earnings over the course of a month, and then at the beginning of the following month your earnings are finalized and posted to your balance on your payments page.</p>

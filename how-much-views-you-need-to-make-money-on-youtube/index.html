For me here in washington state, i estimated that 2 million views is what it would take. According to several sources, youtubers.</p>
<h3 id="once-you-get-your-channel-monetized-every-single-view-will-make-you-around-0004-to-0016-per-view">Once You Get Your Channel Monetized, Every Single View Will Make You Around $0.004 To $0.016 Per View.</h3><p>To give you an idea, if all 1 million subscribers watched two videos per week, you could receive a whopping $36,000 per week just from adsense. Once your channel is monetized, you will earn between $0.004 and $0.016 per view. If you have a beauty channel, you would likely need 600,000 views a month to make the coveted. You may have heard that you’ll make one.</p>
<h3 id="get-ad-revenue-from-display-overlay-and">Get Ad Revenue From Display, Overlay, And.</h3><p>However, youtube doesn’t pay per million views. Some comments are way off. At this level of viewership, you’ll actually be making $2 per 1,000 views too. The channel must have 1000 subscribers.</p>
<h3 id="youtube-pays-as-per-cpm-cost-per-1000-impressions">Youtube Pays As Per Cpm (Cost Per 1000 Impressions.).</h3><p>Say you want to make $100 from just ads and your channel’s cpm is $2 per 1,000 views ($.002/mille). How much money can you make from youtube? To get paid by youtube, you will need to generate $100 or more. They paid per 1000 views but currently, a majority of advertisers pay based on ppc (pay per click).</p>

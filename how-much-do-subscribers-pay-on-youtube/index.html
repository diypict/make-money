<p>A channel with exactly 1,000 subscribers could reasonably expect to bring in $10 to $300 in monthly adsense revenue. The channel must have at least 40,000 watched hours. Two key metrics for earning money on youtube are the cpm rate. how much does youtube pay per view pay for youtube subscriber.</p>
<h3 id="generally-speaking-youtubers-generate-around-18-per-1000-ad-viewsor-between-3-and-5-for-the-same-number-of-views-on-their-actual-video">Generally Speaking, Youtubers Generate Around $18 Per 1,000 Ad Views—Or Between $3 And $5 For The Same Number Of Views On Their Actual Video.</h3><p>And i will share some examples from my channel dashboard.💡 subscri. Now let’s say they uploaded an average of 1 video per week. This would leave the youtuber with a salary of $57,200 per year. You are already aware that your revenue can vary depending on the kind of ads and the number of views.</p>
<h3 id="it039s-impossible-to-answer-because-5-million-subscribers-doesn039t-mean-anything-unless-you-can-get-those-5-million-views-and-their-friends-and-family-to-actually-watch-whatever-it-is-you-make">It�s Impossible To Answer, Because 5 Million Subscribers Doesn�t Mean Anything, Unless You Can Get Those 5 Million+ Views And Their Friends And Family To Actually Watch Whatever It Is You Make.</h3><p>As a result, it comes around from $3 to $5 per 1,000 video views. In my study based on 100 channels, the average revenue paid to youtube creators was $6.40 per 1,000 views (rpm). Simply put, 5m subscribers does not guarantee 5m views per video. Let’s say that all of this youtuber’s subscribers watched their video (and no one else did) and that they had 1 ad per video.</p>
<h3 id="quality-of-traffic-source-country-niche-type-of-video-price-of-specific-ads-adblock-the-actual-click-rate-etc">Quality Of Traffic, Source Country, Niche Type Of Video, Price Of Specific Ads, Adblock, The Actual Click Rate, Etc.</h3><p>Youtube pays between $0.10 and $0.30 per ad view. You must have not less than 4000 watch hours in the past year. Just keep in mind that there are many factors that affect what youtubers with 100k subscribers usually earn and the most important are niche, video. For every 1,000 ad views, advertisers pay a certain rate to youtube.</p>
<h3 id="additionally-i-want-to-keep-feeding-some-content-thats-searchable-so-new-people-can-find-my-channel">Additionally, I Want To Keep Feeding Some Content That’s Searchable So New People Can Find My Channel.</h3><p>So you receive 55% of every dollar paid by advertisers) the estimated earnings that the average youtube creator could expect to receive from ads on a new video on their channel if everybody watched the ad on their video and the advertiser paid the average $7.60 cpm is 55% x $7.60, equaling $4.18 per 1,000 views. The median rpm was $4.38. For youtube creators, why they prefer to work with sponsors is obvious. If we translate this into average payments, we can safely say that the average is $0.18 per ad view.</p>
